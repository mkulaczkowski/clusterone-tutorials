This repository is a collection of code for our tutorials for [Clusterone](https://clusterone.com), [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org), and other related things. The tutorials themselves are published on the [Clusterone website](https://clusterone.com/tutorials), while the code lives here in this repository.

We have several tutorials available:

- [Distributed TensorFlow](tf-estimator/): An introduction to writing distributed TensorFlow code. Read the tutorial post [here](https://clusterone.com/tutorials/distributed-tensorflow) and [here](https://clusterone.com/tutorials/distributed-tensorflow-part-2).
- [Distributed Horovod & XGBoost with OpenMPI](openmpi/): An introduction tutorial to distributed OpenMPI machine learning training. Read the tutorial post [here](https://clusterone.com/tutorials/openmpi-introduction).
- [CycleGAN with distributed PyTorch](pytorch-cyclegan/): An advanced tutorial on training a CycleGAN model with distributed PyTorch. Read the tutorial post [here](https://clusterone.com/tutorials/pytorch-cyclegan).
- [The Titanic Tutorial](titanic/): A basic TensorFlow tutorial utilizing TensorFlow 1.5 and its new high-level Estimators. The code trains a model to predict the survival of passengers of the Titanic based on the passenger list. Read the tutorial post [here](https://clusterone.com/tutorials/tensorflow-titanics).
- [How to Use TensorBoard](tensorboard/): An introduction to TensorFlow's visualization suite, containing information how to create graphs, scalar plots, output images, and more. Read the tutorial post [here](https://clusterone.com/tutorials/tensorboard-part-1) and [here](https://clusterone.com/tutorials/tensorboard-part-2).

There are more tutorials available on our [website](https://clusterone.com/tutorials).

Each tutorial has its own README file that explains how to get the code running. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, please feel free to reach out to us on [Slack](https://bit.ly/2OPc6JH)!
